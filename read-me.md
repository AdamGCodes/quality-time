ReadMe Template Worksheet

Your ReadMes are the key deliverable that engineers will want to see as part of your job search. Each engineering team will look at different aspects of your ReadMe and repo. Some will go into the code itself and explore. Others will just want to see the showcase code snippets in the main ReadMe. Some will read the full thing to understand your approach, others will skim to specific sections.

It’s crucial that you cover all the different sections below to ensure that you’ve got the information for all engineers that check these out. 

We regularly have employers discuss the importance of the ReadMes in what they’re looking for and why they interview the grads that they do - so don’t underestimate the importance of writing strong ReadMes! 

For any pair or group project, you cannot share a ReadMe. These must be written independently to ensure that the engineers reading this understands your specific experience and approach. 

It’s a good idea to start your ReadMes during the planning stage as this is the best way to get ahead and save time when it comes to finalising your first draft post-project. As you plan each aspect of your project, note down what you intend to do with screenshots of your plan and anything else you think would be useful, then when you execute this part in your code, you can adjust this part of your ReadMe as needed depending on how your process changed, or if it went as planned then you can leave it as it is.

Make a copy of this document for each project you use throughout the course and fill in each section. 

Once the content has been finalised here, you can then quickly upload these onto your GitHub repository later.




Things To Consider:

That there are no spelling mistakes in your ReadMe - if you see a spelling error highlighted below, edit this. 
Some engineers will reject applicants if their ReadMes are full of mistakes. From their perspective, if your ReadMes are full of mistakes, what is your code like…

That your technologies are capitalised correctly - i.e JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB

That your formatting is consistent throughout - headers, indentation, full stops in bullets etc

Any hyperlink included works

That you include images throughout - code snippets, pictures of your planning stage, screenshots of the final project.
These can be still screenshots or gifs
This breaks up the text in your ReadMe and helps to keep the reader engaged

That your ReadMe sounds like you - see this as an opportunity to showcase who you are to the engineering community and prospective employers. 
Think back to the Personal Brand session and how employers want to get a sense of who you are. The content you write should sound as if you’re talking through your experience. 


ReadMe Sections

Description
This is the second of four projects created during week 6 of a 12 week bootcamp. 

Insert your Description here:
Quality Time is a web based aplication that aims to solve the problem of what do to with kids you are looking after. This is mainly parents but could also be used by other family members or friends who provide childcare. We will use the expression parents from this point on but that could mean any one providing child care.

Many parents struggle to know what to do with kids and how to make sure that tie spent together is enriching and rewarding for the kids and the adults. Quality Time aims to help address this challenge by providing a library of practical and affordable activities to do with children. Activities will use a system of categories or "tags" to help ensure users are able to filter content to meet their specific needs. This might include categories such as age of child(ren), indoor activities, outdoor activities, in the car, spur of the moment (I've got nothing with me) ideas that can be done with common object etc. 

Each activity will set out the resources required and clear and concise instructions as to how to set up and run the activity. 

Registered users will be able to build out a profile with further information to help tailor their expreince and the content they are presented. 

In adition to this registered users will also be able to:
Add their own activities using a form.
Edit or delete there own activities. 
Comment on their own and others activities.
Like/favourite others activities.

Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)

This project will be created in one week with an MVP target set and multiple stretch goals. Any stretch goals not achieved by the end of the project week can be added to the future developement section. 

This is a solo project.

Brief
One week to create a CRUD application of our choice using skills learned previously on the course, specificlaly using the MEN stack we have been working with over the last two weeks. 

!!!!!!!!!!!! How much detail to go in here do we need to past all project deliverables here or just an overview?




Planning
Starting with a fairly comprehensive user story that outlined the key expectations of each user group I then moved on to creating a wireframe to plan out the user experience and interactions within the site. 

I then moved on to defining the architecture of my required data sets as the basis for planning how the relationships between different sets of data. 

From here I moved on to my RESTful routing table to build the skeliton of the site pages as well as all other routes that would be required to accomplish MVP. At this stage I added routes that might be required only in stretch goals in the eventuality that I reach MVP and was able to scale/expand the app. 



Build/Code Process

Instructions

The Build/Code Process will be the longest section of your ReadMe and will be most insightful to the engineers that review them. This is where you will discuss the steps you took to code the project.

You want to see your ReadMes as a way to walk the engineers through your approach and problem solving from the start of the project through to the end.

You'll need to include a minimum of 3-4 code snippets, highlighting code you're particularly proud of and these code snippets will have descriptions on what you did, how and why to set the context of the snippet you include. These explanations are important for the engineers, as they will want to understand what you did and the reasoning behind the steps you took.

You don't need to document every single thing you coded, but walk them through the key sections of the project build.

For any group project, you will just focus on your contributions. 

Some people will document the build/code process by discussing the key stages they worked on. Others will do a day by day guide. It’s entirely up to you how you structure this, as long as you discuss all the key things above.

Challenges

Instructions

Challenges are great for showing your learning journey and problem solving, and this is a section that many engineers will check out. Every day of your engineering career you’ll encounter challenges, this is part of your growth and development. It’s the challenges you encounter that helps you become a stronger and more competent engineer. 

Here you will detail any particular challenges you encountered as you were coding the project. 

Questions to answer here:

What technical challenges did you come across? 
Why were these challenges? 
What problem solving did you do to rectify them?
Team dynamics/ Project management
Tools/Tech you used

Insert your Challenges here:




Wins

Instructions

The Wins section is your opportunity to highlight the aspects of your project you are most proud of. See this as your chance to showcase these parts of your projects to the engineers reading your ReadMes.

Things you could discuss here:

Interesting problem solving you did
Strong sections of code
Collaboration with other team members
Visual design of the project

Insert your Wins here:


Key Learnings/Takeaways

Instructions

This section is one of the other most important parts of your ReadMe from an engineers’ perspective and helps to differentiate each of you from your classmates and team members. 

Engineers love to understand what you learn from each project and how it has shaped you as an engineer. 

See this as your opportunity to show the engineers how your skills grew during each project sprint. 

Things you could discuss here:

What Technologies/Tools do you now feel more confident with? Tell them specifically what you learnt about these. 
What engineering processes did you become more comfortable with? Standups? Pair programming? Project management? Tell them what you learnt from these processes?

Insert your Key Learnings/Takeaways here:





Bugs

Instructions

If you have any bugs in your project, it’s important that you flag them in your ReadMe. This helps the engineers reviewing your projects to understand that you are aware that there are issues - if you don’t flag these, then they won’t have that visibility that you know these problems are in your code and it can result in them not having a full understanding of your technical knowledge. 

In either sentences or bullets, explain what the bugs are.

If you have no bugs, you can leave this section blank.

Insert your Bugs here:



Future Improvements

Instructions

It’s common to get to the end of your project and have ideas on what you would do if you have more time, as well as how you might improve it. 

If you do, you should detail this here. It’s great to give that context on potential future improvements, to share your creative or technical ideas with the engineers reading your ReadMes.

In either sentences or bullets, explain what your future improvements would be.
