# **Quality Time** – Project Overview  

## **Description**  
**Quality Time** is a web-based application that helps caregivers find engaging activities to share with children. Designed for parents, family members, and friends providing childcare, the app offers a library of practical, affordable activities filtered by customizable categories, such as age group, location (indoor/outdoor), or available resources.  

Registered users can:  
- Add, edit, or delete activities through an intuitive form.  
- Comment on and like activities.  
- Build a personalized profile to track their favorite activities and contributions.  

The app emphasizes user-generated content, empowering the community to share unique ideas and solutions for quality time with children.

## **Development Process**  

### **Planning**  
Detailed planning included user stories, wireframes, data architecture, and RESTful routing. Using tools like Figma and Trello, I defined an MVP and future stretch goals, balancing development priorities and user needs.  

### **Build Process**  
1. **Setup:** Installed dependencies, structured the project, and created routes and controllers for MVP.  
2. **Feature Implementation:** Developed CRUD functionality for sparks, authentication, and comments.  
3. **UI/UX Enhancements:** Focused on responsive design, accessibility, and error handling.  
4. **Advanced Features:** Added likes, image uploads, and user profiles.

## **Key Learnings**  
1. **Thorough Planning:** Investing time in planning improved the development flow, reduced errors, and enabled more time for refinement.  
2. **Testing & Debugging:** Regular testing helped identify and resolve issues efficiently, fostering a deeper understanding of the MEN stack.

## **Challenges**  
- Navigating the complexities of back-end syntax and RESTful routing.  
- Ensuring the app was responsive, accessible, and intuitive for a wide audience.  
- Balancing ambitious stretch goals within the given timeframe.

## **Wins**  
- Successfully implemented a visually appealing card-based design for sparks and comments.  
- High accessibility scores (mid to high 90s).  
- Prototyped a tagging system, laying the groundwork for future improvements.

## **Bugs**  
- User profile edit functionality does not update data in the database.  
- Flash messages and error handling need refinement.  
- Mobile optimization requires additional styling for better performance.

## **Future Improvements**  
1. Implement a tagging and filtering system for better activity matching.  
2. Add a 0–5 star rating scale and average ratings display.  
3. Improve mobile responsiveness and performance.  
4. Enable downloadable/printable activity pages with printer-friendly styling.  
5. Implement email verification and admin moderation for submissions.  
6. Create an admin dashboard with analytics and user insights.
